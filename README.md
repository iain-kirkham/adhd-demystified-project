## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

1. Title: Clear homepage purpose

Story: As a Visitor, I want the homepage to communicate the site's purpose within 10 seconds so that I can decide whether it's relevant to me.

2. Title: Informational symptom & education cards

Story: As an Explorer user, I want easily browsable informational cards about symptoms and ADHD types so that I can learn, compare, and decide which next steps are relevant to me.

3. Title: Diagnosis information flow (informational links)

Story: As a Concerned adult/Parent, I want a clear informational flow with links so that I can learn how to get a diagnosis and take practical next steps.

4. Title: Mobile usability

Story: As a Mobile user, I want readable text and large tappable targets so that I can use the site comfortably on my phone.

5. Title: Keyboard & screen-reader navigation

Story: As an Accessibility-focused user, I want keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly tabs and navigation so that I can fully access content.

6. Title: Privacy-first contact form

Story: As a Contact form user, I want a simple, privacy-respecting contact form so that I can ask a question without oversharing.

7. Title: Resource accordion

Story: As a Resource seeker, I want a resource accordion with short summaries so that I can expand items to read details and find trusted sources quickly.

8. Title: Header anchor links

Story: As a Visitor, I want quick anchor links in the header so that I can jump to relevant sections without scrolling.

10. Title: Shareable resource links

Story: As a Clinician/Advocate, I want shareable resource links so that I can easily recommend specific items to others.

12. Title: Resource filters by audience

Story: As a Resource browser, I could filter resources by audience (Adults, Teens, Parents) so that I find relevant materials faster.

14. Diagnostic assessments online (WON'T)

Story: As a User, I will not be able to complete a clinical diagnostic assessment online; the site provides guidance and signposting only.

### Wireframes

I have sketeched out three different wireframes for different primary breakpoints these being mobile, tablet, and desktop in balsamiq.

![Wireframe](readme-assets/wireframes.png)

### Typography
We use two simple, highly readable sans‑serif fonts from Google Fonts:

- Inter for body text due to its neutral lettering and clarity at small sizes.
- Nunito Sans for headings chosen for well‑balanced shapes that work well with my body text Inter.

Why these fonts?

- Simplicity and clarity: both fonts have clean, open glyphs that improve legibility for many readers.
- Accessibility-focused choices: a sans‑serif family which help readers with disabilities such as dyslexia find sans‑serif typefaces easier to read.


### Colour Scheme

![Colour palette](readme-assets/colourpalette.png)

I have decided to use a calming pastel colour theme, this is to provide the users with a calming and warm mood. I have generated the colour palette with [Vennage](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator). This website creates palettes that are Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliant to help me ensure all users can read even if they have visual imparements.

## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub

- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Deloying on Github

The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:

- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.
